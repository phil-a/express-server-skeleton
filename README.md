###Simple Express Server

A simple server to allow developers to quickly serve test data via HTTP for their front-end.

This makes it easier to write your front-end application once (without hard-coding test data) so that there is no need to restructure it later for HTTP requests.

###Installing & Running
To install and run simply follow these steps:

1)  Clone this repo

2)  Open your terminal and run `node server.js`

3)  Your server is now available at `http://localhost:6061/`

4)  You can run a quick test by entering this in your browser: `http://localhost:6061/ingredients`

5)  Build your test data right in the server.js file. Create new endpoints as needed
